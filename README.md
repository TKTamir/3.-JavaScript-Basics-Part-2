● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.

○ The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.  
○ The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.  
● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.  
○ The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).  
● The app must not throw any errors when being used.  
● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).  
● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
